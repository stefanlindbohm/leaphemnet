LeapHemnet
==========

Use the Leap Motion Controller to choose the size of your home! This is a quick hacked together tool translating the
distance you show with your hands into a search at a local instance of hemnet.se.

You need to get some files from the Leap SDK. Pop them at the following paths.

 - libLeap.dylib
 - LeapHemnet/Leap.h
 - LeapHemnet/LeapMath.h
 - LeapHemnet/LeapObjectiveC.h
 - LeapHemnet/LeapObjectiveC.mm
