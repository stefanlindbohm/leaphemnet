LeapHemnet
==========

Use the Leap Motion Controller to the size of your home! This is a quick hacked together tool translating the home
size you show with your hands into a search for that size at a local instance of hemnet.se.

Getting started
---------------

You need to get some files from the Leap SDK. Pop them at the following paths.

 - libLeap.dylib
 - LeapHemnet/Leap.h
 - LeapHemnet/LeapMath.h
 - LeapHemnet/LeapObjectiveC.h
 - LeapHemnet/LeapObjectiveC.mm
